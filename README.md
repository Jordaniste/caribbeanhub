# What Is Caribbean Hub ?

Caribbean Hub is a Slack community created by RaphaÃ«l Beaupied <https://twitter.com/Raphael_B> and Jordan Vernon <https://twitter.com/Jordaniste> dedicated to the Caribbean entrepreneurship.
The first one actually!

Our goal is to connect entrepreneurs and professionals from the tech industry in this area in order to chat, share and learn from each other.
